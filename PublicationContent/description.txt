[h1]Description:[/h1]
If players have not voted for the next map, a random official map from the current map cycle will be selected.
When connecting to a server, players no longer need to load a custom map if they are not going to play on it.
It's a server-side mutator, it doesn't need to be loaded on the client.

[h1]The mutator is not whitelisted![/h1]
You will not gain experience for playing with this mutator.
